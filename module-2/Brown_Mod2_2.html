        <h2>Chapter Title: Introduction to Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">I grew up in Marion NC, it is a very small town where everyone knows everyone. The area I grew up in didn't have much of a choice when it came to things to do so I turned to skateboarding and playing basketball. I have always had a passion for computers and the capabilites that you have with computers.</p>

        <p>I come from a family of 4 that included my mom, sister and brother. Growing up we spent a lot of time together watching movies or just hanging out. Those were the good ole days.</p>

        <p>One of my biggest hobbies is streaming video games on the Twitch platform. I have been streaming for about 4 years now and love it just as much as when I started. Outside of streaming I enjoy spending time with my family. I am now married for 12 years with 4 boys and a black lab.</p>

        <p>On top of my hobbies and spending time with my family I am passionate about software development.I have become somewhat really fascinated with web design, and hope to learn as much as possible so that I can drive a long career in this field. <span class="sentence">I hope to oneday do web design on the side while being a full time streamer.</span></p>
